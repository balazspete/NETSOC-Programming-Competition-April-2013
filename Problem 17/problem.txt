Short

Given n and k, find the number of pairs of integers (a, b) such that n < a < k, n < b < k and ab-n is divisible by (a-n)(b-n).

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5). Then t test cases follow, each test case consists of a line containing two integers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 100000, n < k ≤ 1018).

Output

For each test case output one line containing the required number.
(Add an additional newline character to the end of your output)

Example

Input:
2
1 5
2 5

Output:
2
3
